✨ Why TypeScript matters ✨
=====================

A talk about TypeScript!

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

    ```sh
    $ yarn install
    ```

2. Start the webpack server. The server will run at the default `webpack-dev-server` address, [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080).

    ```sh
    $ yarn start

    # Or with a specific port!
    $ yarn start --port=3000
    ```

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running

```sh
$ yarn build
```
